  attackDescriptions:
  - You hear it say "You're so stupid, the professor already went over this section."
  - It tells you "Everyone's going to stare."
  - It questions you by asking "What if your voice cracks?"
  - You overhear it saying "I bet they get Fs if they ask questions like that."
  - Staring at it fills you with dread and unanswered questions.
  - As it holds up its hand, you realize you held up your hand too. You quickly retract
    it.
  - Questions overtake your mind, but you hold them in. It feels like you are about
    to burst.
  - It stares at you as if it was judging you before you even asked your question.
