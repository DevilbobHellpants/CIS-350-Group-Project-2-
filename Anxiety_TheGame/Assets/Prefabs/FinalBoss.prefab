  attackDescriptions:
  - You hear voices tell you "Ugly people will never find true love, you should just
    give up."
  - The voices declair that "You're so stupid, there are rocks with more braincells
    than you."
  - The voices reveal that "You get annoyed at the slightest noise. Why would anyone
    want to spend time with you?"
  - Multiple voices utter the words "Nobody really cares about you, they're just
    trying to be nice."
  - Thousands of voices say at once "The world would be a better place without you
    in it."
  - Staring into the thing brings you to your knees from the terror you felt.
  - You remember this is inside you, and you despise it.
  - You wonder if it is even possible to defeat a creature like whats in front of
    you.
  - The anxiety inside feels like it is about to burst out and join what's in front
    of you.
  - This is impossible.
